  abstract = {The logging is the leading cause for the reduction in the forest area in the world. At the same time, the number of forest clearcuts continues to grow. However, despite the massive scale, such incidents are difficult to track in time. As a result, huge areas of forests are gradually being cut down. Therefore, there is a need for regular and effective monitoring of changes in forest cover. The multitemporal data sources like Copernicus Sentinel-2 allow enhancing the potential of monitoring the Earth's surface and environmental dynamics including forest plantations. In this article, we present a baseline U-Net model for deforestation detection in the forest-steppe zone. Training and evaluation are conducted on our own dataset created on Sentinel-2 imagery for the Kharkiv region of Ukraine (31 400 km\textasciicircum 2). As a part of the research, we present several models with the ability to work with time-dependent imagery. The main contribution of this article is to provide a baseline model for the forest change detection inside Ukraine and improve it adding the ability to use several sequential images as an input of the segmentation model. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

This paper compares methods for semantic segmentation of forest damage in different regions of the European territory of Russia and the Urals based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In this paper, it is selected the most informative features among the different spectral bands, their differences and the vegetation indices based on them. Three segmentation methods are compared: random forest, gradient boosting and U-net architecture convolutional neural network. The Dice coefficient is used for evaluation. As a result, the U-Net CNN model was the highest with a coefficient of 78.69\% compared to 55.85\% and 54.06\% respectively for the best RF and XGBoost models. © 2024 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Satellite imagery is important for many applications including disaster response, law enforcement, and environmental monitoring. These applications require the manual identification of objects and facilities in the imagery. Because the geographic expanses to be covered are great and the analysts available to conduct the searches are few, automation is required. Yet traditional object detection and classification algorithms are too inaccurate and unreliable to solve the problem. Deep learning is a family of machine learning algorithms that have shown promise for the automation of such tasks. It has achieved success in image understanding by means of convolutional neural networks. In this paper we apply them to the problem of object and facility recognition in high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery. We describe a deep learning system for classifying objects and facilities from the IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) dataset into 63 different classes. The system consists of an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and additional neural networks that integrate satellite metadata with image features. It is implemented in Python using the Keras and TensorFlow deep learning libraries and runs on a Linux server with an NVIDIA Titan X graphics card. At the time of writing the system is in 2nd place in the fMoW TopCoder competition. Its total accuracy is 83\%, the F1score is 0.797, and it classifies 15 of the classes with accuracies of 95\% or better.},
